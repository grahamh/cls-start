# cls-start
Clojurescript Base File and Directory Structure

Contains the following structure
hello-world        # Our project folder
├─ src             # The CLJS source code for our project
│  └─ hello_world  # Our hello_world namespace folder
│     └─ core.cljs # Our main file
├─ cljs.jar        # (Windows only) The standalone Jar you downloaded earlier
└─ deps.edn        # (macOS/Linux only) A file for listing our dependencies


obviously need to rename the two hello world folders to something appropriate for your project.
